# Announcing the Open-Source Transition of Khiops

We are excited to embark on a transformative chapter in the story of Khiops: our transition to open-source. This strategic shift reflects our commitment to promoting a more inclusive, collaborative, and innovative ecosystem around our product.<!-- more --> 

## Introducing khiops.org in Beta
As part of this new direction, we reveal our reworked documentation website: khiops.org (replacing khiops.com). It represents our commitment to demystifying and popularizing the MODL approach. It's worth noting, however, that we are currently in a beta phase. Your feedback during this phase will be invaluable to us.

## Expanding Access to Khiops
In addition to our historical standalone applications, which remain production-ready, we're thrilled to introduce newer avenues to access Khiops. We are rolling out a Conda package and a Docker Khiops-notebook, both currently in Beta. Our goal is to improve user experience and accessibility.

## A Glance into the Future
Among the features already embedded within Khiops is co-clustering, a powerful unsupervised data analysis method. Though it exists, we recognize the need to invest significant effort in presenting it in a way that aligns with the accessibility standards of our new documentation. This will be done in the first half of 2024.

Our innovation doesn't stop there. We're preparing the upcoming Khiops V11 release, which promises advancements like handling textual content within tabular data.

Stay tuned for more updates, and thank you for being part of this remarkable journey!
