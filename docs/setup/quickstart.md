# Quickstart Guide

The user-friendly Khiops Python library provides a unique [Auto-ML pipeline][what_makes_khiops_different]. Khiops offers significant practical advantages, based on an original formalism: 

- Advanced Automation
- Model Interpretability
- Outstanding Scalability

## Auto-ML as Simple as a Regular Classifier 

The Khiops Python library allows users to set-up Auto-ML pipelines which automate supervised Machine Learning, e.g. for classifying input examples into predefined groups, each identified by a label. Common applications include predicting customer churn (Yes or No), the severity of a failure (Minor, Major, Critical) etc. 

Featuring [unique learning algorithms][original_formalism], Khiops automates many steps seamlessly for the user. For example, there's no longer any need to prepare training data, as [missing values, noise, outliers and unbalanced classes][no_data_preparation] are handled for you. [Encoding categorical variables][encoding] is also no longer a problem. 

Ultimately, all you need to do is use the standard Scikit-Learn syntax, and Khiops takes care of handling poor-quality raw data, producing competitive, robust and interpretable models.  


A minimal code sample is shown below. More detailed [tutorials][tuto] are available.

### üîß Setup


```python
# Straightforward installation using conda.
#!conda install -c khiops khiops
```


```python
# Import of the used packages.
import pandas as pd

from khiops.sklearn import KhiopsClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
```

### üìä Load Sample Dataset


```python
# Loading and reading the data file into a Pandas DataFrame.
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KhiopsML/khiops-samples/main/Adult/Adult.txt"
df = pd.read_csv(url, delimiter='\t',index_col="Label")
```


```python
# Drop the "class" column to create the feature set (X).
X = df.drop("class", axis=1)
```


```python
# Extract the "class" column to create the target labels y (useful for
performance analysis of the models).
y = df["class"].map({'less': 0, 'more': 1})
```


```python
# Randomly split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)
```

### üöÄ Just fit it


```python
# Declare classifier object and train the Auto-ML pipeline
clf = KhiopsClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### üîÆ Predict 


```python
# Predict labels on the testing set
pred = clf.predict(X_test)
```

## Auto Feature Engineering as Simple as Writing a Dictionary 

[Feature Engineering][Auto_feature_engineering] aims to build a training set from multi-table data, by summarizing the useful information from the secondary tables. For example, let's consider multi-table data where the root table describes the customers of a telecommunications operator (with one record per customer) and the secondary tables each describe call details, services used, contracts (with a varying number of records per customer). In this case, the *''call rate to foreign countries''* could be a useful aggregate for predicting customer churn.

[Auto_feature_engineering]: /learn/autofeature_engineering

In practice, when undertaken manually, Feature Engineering is an extremely time-consuming task which is not efficient and risks over-fitting (i.e. when using over-complex aggregates). Just feed multi-table data into the Khiops Auto-ML pipeline to trigger an ultra-efficient [automatic Feature Engineering algorithm][Auto_feature_engineering]. All you need to do is describe the structure of the input multi-table data with a dictionary.

### üñãÔ∏è Simply describe your multi-table data

Below, we only show the `syntax` to be used when describing multi-table data. For a running code sample, please refer to the [dedicated page][full_pipeline].
We continue with the previous example, where the multi-table data describes the customers of a telecommunications operator and where the goal is to predict the churn:

Khiops allows users to describe multi-table data as a Python dictionary ([a running sample is available][MT_tutorial]). Here's an example: 

[MT_tutorial]: /advanced/Notebooks/Use_in_any_ML_pipeline/


```python
X_train = {
    "main_table": "Customer",
    "tables": {
        "Customer": (customer_main_df, "CustomerId"),
        "Call": (call_df, ["CustomerId", "CallId"]),
        "Service": (service_df, ["CustomerId", "ServiceId"]),
        "Contract": (contract_df, ["CustomerId", "ContractId"]),
    },
    "relations": [
        ("Customer", "Call"),
        ("Customer", "Service"),
        ("Customer", "Contract"),
    ],
}
```

This dictionary includes three attributes: 

- `main_table` indicating the name of the main table,
- `tables` describing all tables, 
- `relations` specifying the links between tables. 

`main table` is itself a dictionary, composed of one record per table. For each record, the *key* corresponds to the table name and the *value* is a tuple associating a Pandas Dataframe and a list of keys (first the main key, then the secondary keys). And `relations` is a list of tuples, which indicate the links between tables.

### üöÄ Just fit it ... as usual

Once you've described the multi-table input data, no further effort is required.


```python
# Declare the classifier declaration and train the full pipeline
clf = KhiopsClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## Visualizing the Analysis Reports 

The analysis report contains details on the features obtained by the Khiops Auto Feature Engineering algorithm, the encoding of variables, the selection of variables and their importance for predictions. 

You can open and visualize the report using the standalone visualization desktop application on several operating systems. More details on this visualization desktop application can be found on the [dedicated page][visu].

[visu]: /setup/visualization

To generate the analysis report, you need to specify the `output_dir` parameter when creating the `KhiopsClassifier` estimator object instance: 

```python
# Classifier declaration with a specifed output directory
clf = KhiopsClassifier(output_dir="User/Documents/test_khiops")
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Open the `AllReports.khj` file on the visualization desktop application:
