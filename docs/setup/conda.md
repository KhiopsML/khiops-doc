# Install the Khiops Library Using Conda <small>  ðŸš§ Beta ðŸš§ </small>

The Conda package installation guarantees optimal performance since it handles installing or upgrading all Khiops dependencies, including the MPI library, in your Conda environment. 

## Instructions

=== "x86-64"
    ``` sh
    conda install -c khiops khiops
    ```

=== ":material-apple: Apple Silicon (ARM64)"
    ``` sh
    conda install -c conda-forge -c khiops khiops
    ```


## User Guide

- For those who aren't familiar with Conda, you can start by reading [**Getting started with Conda**][conda-user-guide].

## What You Should Know

You can consult the limitations or known problems corresponding to your operating system:

=== "Users on :material-microsoft-windows: Windows"
    !!! warning 
        On the first run of Khiops, **an MPI-related popup may appear** due to parallel execution sockets; please allow access for optimal functionality.

    !!! warning 
        Windows users already having MSMPI installed may see an Anaconda warning suggesting to uninstall it; please ignore this message.


=== "Users on :material-apple: Apple Silicon"
    !!! warning 

        The installation of Khiops will utilize MPICH version 3.4.3 due to compatibility issues. 
        This is why you need to use a dedicated command:
        ``` sh
        conda install -c conda-forge -c khiops khiops
        ```
            
        Be aware that this may result in **slower execution times** compared to other platforms. This limitation is expected to be addressed in a future MPICH release.
    !!! warning 
        On the first run of Khiops, **an MPI-related popup may appear** due to parallel execution sockets; please allow access for optimal functionality.
